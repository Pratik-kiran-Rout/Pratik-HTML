     <h3>Generative AI</h3>
     <pre>Generative AI models, such as DALL-E and MidJourney, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating high-quality, photorealistic images and text based on complex descriptions. These models have the potential to revolutionize industries like art, design, and entertainment.
     
     Artificial intelligence (AI) systems already greatly impact our lives — they increasingly shape what we see, believe, and do. Based on the steady advances in AI technology and the significant recent increases in investment, we should expect AI technology to become even more powerful and impactful in the following years and decades.

     It is easy to underestimate how much the world can change within a lifetime, so it is worth taking seriously what those who work on AI expect for the future. Many AI experts believe there is a real chance that human-level artificial intelligence will be developed within the following decades, and some think it will exist much sooner.
          
     How such powerful AI systems are built and used will be very important for the future of our world and our own lives. All technologies have positive and negative consequences, but with AI, the range of these consequences is extraordinarily large: the technology has immense potential for good. Still, it comes with significant downsides and high risks.
          
     A technology that has such an enormous impact needs to be of central interest to people across our entire society. But currently, the question of how this technology will get developed and used is left to a small group of entrepreneurs and engineers.
